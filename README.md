# esphome-daikin-s21

ESPHome component to control Daikin indoor mini-split units with s21 ports.

Many thanks to the work by [revk][1] on the fantastic [Faikin][2] project,
which was the primary inspiration and guide for building this ESPHome
component. In addition, the very active and resourceful community that
project has fostered that has decoded much of the protocol.

A huge thanks to [joshbenner][4], the original author of this integration.
His [repository][5] would be my preferred place to commit patches to avoid
fragmentation, but he lacks the time at the moment to manage the project.

## Features

### Climate
* Setpoint temperature.
* Selectable climate modes OFF, HEAT_COOL, COOL, HEAT, FAN_ONLY and DRY.
* Climate action reporting. See what your unit is trying to do, e.g.
  heating while in HEAT_COOL.
* Fan modes auto, silent and 1-5.
* Swing modes horizontal, vertical, and both.
* Untested support for Powerful and Econo presets ("Boost" and "Eco").
* Optional humidity reporting.
* Limits for commanded setpoints. Defaults should work fine, but if your
  unit is different they can be overridden.

The standard Daikin control loop has a few deficiencies:
* The setpoint value has 1.0째C granularity.
* The current temperature feedback value has 0.5째C granularity.
* The current temperature sensor is located in the unit, in most cases
  a wall unit placed higher in a room. This reading doesn't always reflect
  the temperature felt by occupants.

Because of these, the climate component implements a separate loop on top
of the Daikin internal one. An external temperature sensor can be used
to provide a more accurate and precise reference and an offset applied to
the internal Daikin setpoint. The internal temperature sensor can also be
used for this functionality to drive the coarse setpoint around the more
granular temperature sensor. The rate at which this secondary loop runs
is configurable. All of this is downstream of Daikin's reported temperature
precision and control loop hysteresis, so it's not ideal.

### Sensor
* Inside temperature (usually measured at indoor air handler return)
* Outside temperature (outside exchanger)
* Coil temperature (indoor air handler's coil)
* Fan speed
* Vertical swing angle (directional flap)
* Compressor frequency (outside exchanger)
* Humidity (not supported on all units, will report a consistent 50% if
  not present)
* Unit demand from outside exchanger

### Binary Sensor

New, extracted from the unit and system state bitfields. Still need to observe
to see how valuable these are. I may remove the redundant ones in the future.

* Powerful
* Defrost
* Active (Actively controlling climate, climate action can tell us this)
* Online (In a climate controlling mode, climate mode can tell us this)
* Refrigerant Valve (shadows active?)
* Short Cycle Lock (3 minute compressor lockout)
* System Defrost (shadows defrost?)
* Multizone settings conflict

## Limitations

**NOTE:** Currently there's a serious issue when using the Arduino framework.
If flashed OTA you may lose communication and require a physical reflashing
(annoying if your board in inside your air handler). Please stick to the
ESP-IDF PlatformIO framework for now (Arduino is an extra shim over the ESP-IDF
SDK anyways). See the framework selection in the configuration example.

* This code has only been tested on ESP32 pico and ESP32-S3.
* Tested with 4MXL36TVJU outdoor unit and CTXS07LVJU, FTXS12LVJU, FTXS15LVJU
  indoor units.
* Powerful and econo modes are untested (no v2 hardware).
* Does not support comfort or presence detection features on some models.
* Does not interact with the indoor units schedules (do that with HA instead).
* Currently targets Version 0 protocol support due to the equipment available
  to the author.

## Hardware

### S21 Port

**NOTE:** The Daikin S21 port provides >5V, so if you intend to power your
board on this pin, be sure to test its output and regulate voltage accordingly.

On my Daikin units, the S21 port has the following pins:

* 1 - Unused
* 2 - TX (5V)
* 3 - RX (5V)
* 4 - VCC (>5V!!)
* 5 - GND

The S21 plug is JST `EHR-5` and related header `B5B-EH-A(LF)(SN)`, though the
plug pins are at standard 2.5mm pin header widths.

### PCB Option 1

joshbenner uses the board designed by [revk][1] available [here][3]. Note that
revk's design includes a FET that inverts the logic levels on the ESP's RX pin,
which required using two separate UART devices to get around an ESPHome limit
on having pins inverted differently using the Arduino framework. This handling
is now moved behind the split_uart component.

### PCB Option 2

I am instead using ESP32-S3 mini dev boards and directly wiring communication
to the S21 port. The Daikin unit pulls our TX line up to 5V, so the pin should
be configured as open drain. Instead of driving the line to 0V, it shorts it to
ground through their external pullup resistor. Your Daikin unit may not have
this pullup and may need to be added externally to your circuit. Alternatively
there are cheap level shifter modules available where conventionally driven
outputs will work. The RX line relies on the ESP32's 5V tolerant GPIO pins.
Communication works reliably for me. For power I am using a cheap 5V -> 3.3V
switching module wired into Vcc on the dev board. Don't forget to wire up
ground as well.

## Contributing

If you can write C++, great. Even if you're more of a YAML writer and user,
your assistance with this project would be helpful. Here are some possible
ways:

* Report your experince with different Daikin units. Turning on protocol
  debugging and getting the protocol detection output values would be the first
  step if you encounter issues and help me learn more about the output of
  different models.
* Let me know how useful the binary sensor values are and which just shadow
  other sensor values.
* If you have a revk module with an inverting RX pin, let me know if using a
  single UART configuration and inverting the RX line with ESPHome's pin schema
  works with ESP-IDF and (when it's working again) the Arduino framework. i.e.
  Not using the split_uart component. If so, I can remove this custom code and
  simplify configuration.

See existing issues, open a new one or post in the discussions section with
your findings. Thanks.

## Configuration

On multihead systems some values that come from the outdoor unit will be the
same (accounting for sampling jitter). It's recommended to use ESPHome's
subdevice feature to only configure these sensors on your "primary" ESPHome
instance as a subdevice to keep individual indoor unit representations cleaner.
See the configuration example below. This feature seems designed for the
one-to-many case, whereas this system is more of a many-to-one configuration.
Locally I have two configuration template files, one for indoor only units and
one for a single indoor unit with an outdoor unit subdevice. If I can find a
better solution I'll update the example.

When using an external temperature sensor as a room reference instead of the
internal Daikin value (which may be misleading due to placement of the unit)
it's recommended to change the target_temperature step to 0.5째C to reflect the
granularity of the alternate control loop provided. The default is 1.0째C to
match Daikin's internal granularity.

Here is an example of how daikin_s21 can be used with one inverted UART pin:

```yaml
uart:
  - id: s21_tx
    tx_pin: 26
    baud_rate: 2400
    data_bits: 8
    parity: EVEN
    stop_bits: 2

  - id: s21_rx
    rx_pin:
      number: 27
      inverted: true
    baud_rate: 2400
    data_bits: 8
    parity: EVEN
    stop_bits: 2

split_uart:
  id: split_uart_1
  tx_uart: s21_tx
  rx_uart: s21_rx

daikin_s21:
  uart: split_uart_1
```

Here's an example of a single UART using direct wiring (you can leave out the split_uart component import as well):

```yaml
uart:
  - id: s21_uart
    tx_pin:
      number: GPIO43
      mode:
        output: true
        open_drain: true  # daikin pulls up to 5V internally
    rx_pin: GPIO44
    baud_rate: 2400

daikin_s21:
  uart: s21_uart
```
